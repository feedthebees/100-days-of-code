# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 5th 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've begun the Responsive wed design certification on FreeCodeCamp.com [FCC] and completed the coursework for basic html and html5

**Thoughts** I've started FCC twice before but this time I want to stick with it and complete the certification without getting bored/distracted and dropping out.
