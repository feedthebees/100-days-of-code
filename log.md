# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 5th 2020, Wed

**Today's Progress**: I've begun the Responsive wed design certification on FreeCodeCamp.com [FCC] and completed the coursework for basic html and html5

**Thoughts** I've started FCC twice before but this time I want to stick with it and complete the certification without getting bored/distracted and dropping out.

### Day 2: Feb 6th 2020, Thurs

**Today's Progress**: I've completed about half of the basic CSS challenges on FCC. joined this challenge and created a new twitter to get involved in the community.

**Thoughts** I've done the minimum 1hr but need a break for food/headache and hope to complete more today.
