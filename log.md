### Day 1: Feb 5th 2020, Wed

**Today's Progress**: I've begun the Responsive wed design certification on FreeCodeCamp.com [FCC] and completed the coursework for basic html and html5

**Thoughts** I've started FCC twice before but this time I want to stick with it and complete the certification without getting bored/distracted and dropping out.

### Day 5: Feb 9th 2020, Sun

**Today's Progress**: progressing through applied visual design challenges on FCC. tweeted. focussed on graphic design and began the animation, lots more animation to cover tomorrow. embellished my code pen with box shadows, gradient backgrounds and inserted a link to my twitter profile. 

**Thoughts** coding late again, its tough to stick to coding on the weekends when fammily is around. have to wait til kids are in bed and then give up my down time to code instead of tv/games. but I'm glad I stuck to my commitment.

### Day 6: Feb 10th 2020, Mon

**Today's Progress**: progressing through applied visual design challenges on FCC. tweeted. learning more animation techniques with CSS. the pace is fast since its drip feeding so Im taking my time and tweaked some FCC code over on codepen which was a good opportunity to learn code doesnt copy and paste well! helps me go over and make sure I understand it and find what makes it work.  

**Thoughts** feeling tired and less excited about coding but I Always enjoy it once I get going so I am glad for the accountability.

### Day 7: 2/11/20

**Today's Progress**: finished the visual design coursework and finished almost 1/2 of the accessibility coursework. this is simpler and is retracing some HTML5 I already know but explaining how and why it helps to make the code semantic and accessible with disabilites such as blind or deaf readers.   

**Thoughts** Definitely a good change of pace. CSS was becoming very intense and mind numbing. feels good to recap and solidify familiar languages.
